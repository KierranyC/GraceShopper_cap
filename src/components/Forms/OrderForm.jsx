// This component acts as the Cart checkout window. It should render a list of products beinging purchased, as well as the payment method, and estimated delivery date(this can be randomized I believe??). Customers should be able to customize their cart, change and save payment methods, and receive an order# and order confirmation via email.

// This component COULD become a Modal but not sure how to get them working yet :(
export const OrderForm = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Order Form</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
