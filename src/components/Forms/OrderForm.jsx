// This component acts as the Cart checkout window. It should render a list of products beinging purchased, as well as the payment method, and estimated delivery date(this can be randomized I believe??). Customers should be able to customize their cart, change and save payment methods, and receive an order# and order confirmation via email.

// This component COULD become a Modal but not sure how to get them working yet :(
