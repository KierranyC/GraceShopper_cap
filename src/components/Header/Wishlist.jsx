import React from "react";

// This component should render a list of products saved by the user, with buttons to add products to the cart. *Personally I would like to add notifications price drops or out of stock products for products saved in a wishlist, but I do not know how to implement that :/
export const Wishlist = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 className="text-center">Wishlist</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
